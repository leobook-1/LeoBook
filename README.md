# LeoBook

**Developer**: Matterialless LLC
**Chief Engineer**: Emenike Chinenye James
**Powered by**: Grok 4.1 & Gemini 2.5 Flash
**Architecture**: High-Velocity Concurrent Architecture v3.5 (Shared Locking + Parallel Enrichment)

---

## What Is LeoBook?

LeoBook is an **autonomous sports prediction and betting system** with two halves:

| Component | Tech | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `Leo.py` | Python 3.12 + Playwright | Data extraction, rule-based prediction, odds harvesting, automated bet placement, withdrawal management |
| `leobookapp/` | Flutter/Dart | Elite, cross-platform dashboard with "Telegram-grade" UI density and real-time streaming |

Leo.py is a **pure orchestrator** — zero business logic. All logic lives in the modules it imports. It runs in an infinite cycle (default every 6 hours).

For the complete file inventory and step-by-step execution trace, see [LeoBook_Technical_Master_Report.md](LeoBook_Technical_Master_Report.md).

## System Architecture (v3.2 Concurrent)

```
Leo.py (Orchestrator)
├── Phase 1 (Sequential): Cloud Sync → Outcome Review → Accuracy Report
├── Phase 2 (Parallel Execution):
│   ├── Task A: High-Velocity League Enrichment (Multi-Page)
│   ├── Task B: Async Search Dictionary Building
│   └── Task C: Main Chapter Pipeline (Extraction → Adaptive Prediction → Booking)
├── Phase 3 (Sequential): Chief Engineer Oversight & Withdrawal Management
└── Live Streamer: Background 60s LIVE score streaming → status propagation
```

### Key Innovations (v3.5)
- **High-Velocity Concurrency**: `Leo.py` uses `asyncio.gather` for parallel pipeline execution. `enrich_leagues.py` uses multi-page Playwright concurrency for 5x faster processing.
- **Shared Data Integrity**: Implemented a global `CSV_LOCK` (Asyncio Lock) in `db_helpers.py` ensuring thread-safe access to persistent stores during parallel operations.
- **Async Search Dict**: The search dictionary engine is now fully asynchronous, integrating seamlessly with the high-speed enrichment pipeline.
- **Incremental Persistence**: Data is written per-item, ensuring zero loss if a cycle is interrupted.
- **Hash-Based Identity**: URL hash-based `league_id` for 100% collision-free mapping and stable history tracking.
- **Dual-LLM Fallback**: Logic enrichment now uses Grok as primary and Gemini as secondary fallback for maximum reliability.

### Core Modules

- **`Core/Intelligence/`** — Intelligence engine (rule-based prediction engine, rule config, AIGO self-healing)
- **`Core/Browser/`** — Playwright automation and data extractors (H2H, standings, league pages)
- **`Core/System/`** — Lifecycle, monitoring, withdrawal checker
- **`Modules/Flashscore/`** — Schedule extraction, match processing, offline reprediction, **live score streaming (v2.1 fix)**
- **`Modules/FootballCom/`** — Betting platform automation (login, navigation, odds, booking, bet placement)
- **`Data/Access/`** — CSV CRUD, Supabase sync, outcome review, accuracy calculation
- **`Scripts/`** — Enrichment pipeline, recommendation engine, maintenance utilities
- **`leobookapp/`** — **UI v3.0 (Liquid Glass + Proportional Scaling)**

### AIGO (AI-Guided Operation) — Self-Healing Framework (v5.0)

Five-phase recovery cascade for every browser interaction (~8-18% reach Phase 3):

0. **Context Discovery** — selector lookup from `knowledge.json`
1. **Reinforcement Learning** — memory-based strategy selection
2. **Visual Analysis** — multi-strategy matching (CSS → XPath → text → fuzzy)
3. **Expert Consultation** — Grok API multimodal analysis (screenshot + DOM → primary + backup paths)
4. **Self-Healing & Evolution** — persist AI-discoveries to `knowledge.json` and update `learning_weights.json` via the outcome review loop.

See [AIGO_Learning_Guide.md](AIGO_Learning_Guide.md) for the full pipeline specification.

## LeoBook App (Flutter v3.0)

The v3.0 rebuild introduces a **Telegram-inspired high-density aesthetic** optimized for maximum velocity and visual clarity.

- **Telegram Design Aesthetic** — 80% size reduction for high-density information, increased glass translucency (60% fill), and micro-radii (14dp).
- **Proportional Scaling System** — Custom `Responsive` utility ensures perfect parity between mobile and web without hardcoded pixel values.
- **Supabase Backend** — Cloud-native data for instant global access.
- **Liquid Glass UI** — Premium frosted-glass containers with optimized BackdropFilter performance.
- **4-Tab Match System** — ALL | LIVE | FINISHED | SCHEDULED with automatic 2.5hr status propagation from live streamer.
- **Live Accuracy Tags** — Real-time performance indicators fed by the backend review pipeline.
